# One-Shot-Animal-Video-Segmentation

This repository will make available the source code, datasets, pre-trained weights for the work, "One-shot Learning-based Animal Video Segmentation", which is currently in review.

Our proposed approach achieved mean intersection-over-union score of 89.2% on the DAVIS 2016 animal dataset [1] with only one labeled frame each video.
